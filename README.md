Risk and Return analysis on The Sharpe Ration

The Sharpe ratio has been one of the most popular risk and return measures in finance, not least because it's so simple to use. It also helped that Professor Sharpe won a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1990 for his work on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). When you assess whether to invest in an asset, you want to look not only at how much money you could make but also at how much risk you are taking.
